Hyperion.NG is under heavy development. This version is currently _only for development_ purpose.

Hyperion is an opensource 'AmbiLight' implementation with support for many LED devices and video grabbers.

The main features of Hyperion are:
* Low CPU load makes it perfect for SoCs like Raspberry Pi
* Json interface which allows easy integration into scripts
* A command line utility to for testing and integration in automated environment
* Priority channels are not coupled to a specific led data provider which means that a provider can post led data and leave without the need to maintain a connection to Hyperion. This is ideal for a remote application (like our Android app).
* Kodi-checker which checks the playing status of Kodi and decides whether or not to capture the screen.
* Black border detector.
* A scriptable (Python) effect engine
* A web ui to configure and remote control hyperion
