## About Hyperion

[Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng) is an opensource [Bias or Ambient Lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_lighting) implementation which you might know from TV manufacturers. It supports many LED devices and video grabbers. The project is still in a alpha development stage (no stable release available).

### Features:

* Low CPU load makes it perfect for SoCs like Raspberry Pi
* Json interface which allows easy integration into scripts
* A command line utility for testing and integration in automated environment
* Priority channels are not coupled to a specific led data provider which means that a provider can post led data and leave without the need to maintain a connection to Hyperion. This is ideal for a remote application (like our [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.hyperion.hyperionpro)).
* Black border detector and processor
* A scriptable (Python) effect engine
* A multi language web interface to configure and remote control hyperion
