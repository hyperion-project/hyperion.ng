// WS2812 NeoPixel driver
// Based on code by Richard G. Hirst and others
// Adapted for the WS2812 by 626Pilot, April/May 2014
// See: https://github.com/626Pilot/RaspberryPi-NeoPixel-WS2812
// Version: https://github.com/626Pilot/RaspberryPi-NeoPixel-WS2812/blob/1d43407d9e6eba19bff24330bc09a27963b55751/ws2812-RPi.c

// You are using this at your OWN RISK. I believe this software is reasonably safe to use (aside
// from the intrinsic risk to those who are photosensitive - see below), although I can't be certain
// that it won't trash your hardware or cause property damage.
//
// Speaking of risk, WS2812 pixels are bright enough to cause eye pain and (for all I know) possibly
// retina damage when run at full strength. It's a good idea to set the brightness at 0.2 or so for
// direct viewing (whether you're looking directly at the pixels or not), or to put some diffuse
// material between you and the LEDs.
//
// PHOTOSENSITIVITY WARNING:
// Patterns of light and darkness (stationary or moving), flashing lights, patterns and backgrounds
// on screens, and the like, may cause epilleptic seizures in some people. This is a danger EVEN IF
// THE PERSON (WHICH MAY BE *YOU*) HAS NEVER KNOWINGLY HAD A PHOTOSENSITIVE EPISODE BEFORE. It's up
// to you to learn the warning signs, but symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, vision changes,
// convlusions, disorientation, involuntary movements, and eye twitching. (This list is not
// necessarily exhaustive.)

// Connections:
//		Positive to Raspberry Pi's 3.3v, for better separation connect only ground and data directly
//					(5v can be used then without a problem, at least it worked for me, Kammerjaeger)
//		Negative to Raspberry Pi's ground
// 		Data to GPIO18 (Pin 12) (through a resistor, which you should know from the Best
// 		Practices guide!)

//
//  To activate: use led device "ws2812s" in the hyperion configuration
//                                 (it needs to be root so it can map the peripherals' registers)
//
// =================================================================================================

// This is for the WS2812 LEDs. It won't work with the older WS2811s, although it could be modified
// for that without too much trouble. Preliminary driver used Frank Buss' servo driver, but I moved
// to Richard Hirst's memory mapping/access model because his code already works with DMA, and has
// what I think is a slightly cleaner way of accessing the registers: register[name] rather than
// *(register + name).

// At the time of writing, there's a lot of confusing "PWM DMA" code revolving around simulating
// an FM signal. Usually this is done without properly initializing certain registers, which is
// OK for their purpose, but I needed to be able to transfer actual coherent data and have it wind
// up in a proper state once it was transferred. This has proven to be a somewhat painful task.
// The PWM controller likes to ignore the RPTL1 bit when the data is in a regular, repeating
// pattern. I'M NOT MAKING IT UP! It really does that. It's bizarre. There are lots of other
// strange irregularities as well, which had to be figured out through trial and error. It doesn't
// help that the BCM2835 ARM Peripherals manual contains outright errors and omissions!

// Many examples of this kind of code have magic numbers in them. If you don't know, a magic number
// is one that either lacks an obvious structure (e.g. 0x2020C000) or purpose. Please don't use
// that stuff in any code you release! All magic numbers found in reference code have been changed
// to DEFINEs. That way, instead of seeing some inscrutable number, you see (e.g.) PWM_CTL.
