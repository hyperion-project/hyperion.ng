/// Linear Smooting class
///
/// This class processes the requested led values and forwards them to the device after applying
/// a smoothing effect to LED colors. This class can be handled as a generic LedDevice.
///
/// Currently, two types of smoothing are supported:
///
///  - Linear: A linear smoothing effect that interpolates the previous to the target colors.
///  - Decay: A temporal smoothing effect that uses a decay based algorithm that interpolates
///           colors based on the age of previous frames and a given decay-power.
///
///           The smoothing is performed on a history of relevant LED-color frames that are
///           incorporated in the smoothing window (given by the configured settling time).
///
///           For each moment, all ingress frames that were received during the smoothing window
///           are reduced to the concrete color values using a weighted moving average. This is
///           done by applying a decay-controlled weighting-function to individual the colors of
///           each frame.
///
///           Decay
///           =====
///           The decay-power influences the weight of individual frames based on their 'age'.
///
///           * A decay value of 1 indicates linear decay. The colors are given by the moving average
///           with a weight that is strictly proportionate to the fraction of time each frame was
///           visible during the smoothing window. As a result, equidistant frames will have an
///           equal share when calculating an intermediate frame.
///
///           * A decay value greater than 1 indicates non-linear decay. With higher powers, the
///           decay is stronger. I.e. newer frames in the smoothing window will have more influence
///           on colors of intermediate frames than older ones.
///
///           Dithering
///           =========
///           A temporal dithering algorithm is used to minimize rounding errors, when downsampling
///           the average color values to the 8-bit RGB resolution of the LED-device. Effectively,
///           this performs diffusion of the residual errors across multiple egress frames.
