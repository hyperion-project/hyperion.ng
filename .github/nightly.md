This is a **development version (ðŸŒ™ Nightly Build)** of **Hyperion**.

Would you like to try out new features before they are officially released? Then this version is just right for you!

Nightly builds often fix reproducible bugs. At the same time, newly introduced and not yet fully tested features may cause occasional stability issues â€” so please use this version with some caution.

Also note that changes to the configuration may be made. It is therefore advisable to **export your existing configuration via the WebUI** before using this version.

The `*.deb` and `*.tar.gz` packages are based on **Debian Bullseye** and are tailored for the platform specified in the filename.
If your platform isn't listed, check out our [APT/DNF repository](https://releases.hyperion-project.org/) and try the `Linux -> Easy -> Easy Install Script`.

For Windows, we offer two versions (`*-x64.exe` and `*-arm64.exe`). Both require **Windows 11**.

The macOS installation package `*-x86_64.dmg` requires at least macOS 13.5 (Ventura), and `*-arm64.dmg` requires at least macOS 14.0 (Sonoma).

**Please help us improve Hyperion by reporting any bugs or issues you encounter.** :wink:
