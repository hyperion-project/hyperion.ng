# 🌙 Hyperion — Nightly Build (Development Version)

Would you like to try out new features before they are officially released?
Then the **Nightly Build** version of **Hyperion** is just right for you!

## What to Expect
- Nightly builds often include **bug fixes for known, reproducible issues**.
- However, they may also introduce **new, untested features** that could cause occasional stability problems.
- Please use this version with **caution** if you rely on a stable setup.

 > [!WARNING]
 > Note that changes to the configuration may be made which are not reverted easily. To prevent data loss or configuration conflicts, it's **strongly recommended** to:
 >  - **Export your existing configuration** via the [WebUI](https://docs.hyperion-project.org/user/Configuration.html#configuration-backup)  
 >  - or the [Command Line Interface](https://docs.hyperion-project.org/user/advanced/CLI.html#command-line-interface) before upgrading.
